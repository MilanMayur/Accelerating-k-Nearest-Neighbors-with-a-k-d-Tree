# Accelerating-k-Nearest-Neighbors-with-a-k-d-Tree
This project implements a balanced k-d tree from scratch to accelerate k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classification. It includes fast kNN search, a benchmarking pipeline against scikit-learn’s brute-force kNN on the Iris dataset (scaled version for stress testing), and a short performance report explaining accuracy and latency trade-offs.
